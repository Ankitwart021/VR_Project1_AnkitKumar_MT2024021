# Face Mask Classification and Segmentation Project


This project focuses on the classification and segmentation of face masks in images using both traditional and deep learning techniques. It aims to:
- Classify images as "with mask" or "without mask"
- Segment the mask region on masked faces
- Compare traditional methods with deep learning models like CNNs and U-Net

## observations and Analysis
- **HOG outperformed SIFT** for handcrafted feature-based classification.
- **CNNs significantly outperformed ML classifiers**, showing deep learning's advantage with visual data.
- **U-Net yielded much higher segmentation accuracy** than traditional edge-based approaches.
- Traditional methods are fast but less precise, especially on complex mask shapes.
**Challenges Faced**
1. Feature Extraction Complexity (Task A)

   SIFT and HOG feature extraction required careful preprocessing and resizing of images to ensure consistency.
   Managing dimensionality and converting descriptors into fixed-size input for ML classifiers was challenging.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning in CNNs (Task B)

    Finding the optimal combination of learning rate, batch size, and optimizer involved multiple training runs and time-consuming experiments.
    Overfitting was observed in some configurations and required dropout layers and careful batch sizing.

3. Slow Data Loading and Preprocessing

    Reading and resizing a large number of images (especially from Google Drive) was slow and required optimization or caching with .npy files.

4. Traditional Segmentation Sensitivity (Task C)

    Thresholding and edge detection methods were sensitive to lighting conditions, face orientation, and image contrast.
    Tuning parameters for Canny and morphological operations was difficult to generalize across all images.

5. GPU Usage and Resource Limits (Colab)

    Sometimes the notebook would not utilize the GPU efficiently during data preprocessing.
    Limited session time in Colab required saving intermediate models and results frequently.
